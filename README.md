# Clothing-Website
This project involves creating a dynamic and user-friendly website for a clothing store with several branches. The website includes four main sections: a homepage offering general information about the brand and stores, a store locator page displaying contact details and addresses for each location, an employee information page, and a hiring form to streamline the recruitment process. The site is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, PHP for dynamic content generation, and SQL to manage the store and employee data. This website provides an easy-to-navigate experience for both customers and potential employees, enhancing online visibility and engagement.
